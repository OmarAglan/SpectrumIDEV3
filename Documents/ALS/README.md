# Alif Language Server (ALS)

A world-class Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for the Alif programming language, designed to provide intelligent code analysis, completion, and navigation features for the Spectrum IDE and other LSP-compatible editors.

## Overview

The Alif Language Server (ALS) is a high-performance, asynchronous C++ server that implements the Language Server Protocol to provide rich language support for Alif programs. It replaces the current in-process analysis components (`AlifLexer`, `AlifComplete`) with a dedicated, scalable server architecture.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Asynchronous, non-blocking architecture with worker thread pools
- **Rich Language Support**: Complete syntax analysis, semantic understanding, and intelligent code completion
- **Error Recovery**: Resilient parsing that continues analysis even with syntax errors
- **Project-Wide Intelligence**: Maintains complete workspace state for cross-file analysis
- **LSP Compliance**: Full Language Server Protocol implementation for editor compatibility
- **Extensible Design**: Modular architecture for easy feature additions

## Architecture Highlights

- **Asynchronous Core**: Main thread never blocks on I/O or computation
- **Worker Thread Pool**: Offloads intensive tasks (parsing, analysis, indexing)
- **Workspace Management**: In-memory project model with intelligent caching
- **Error-Tolerant Parser**: Builds partial ASTs even with syntax errors
- **Symbol Resolution**: Project-wide symbol tables for navigation and completion

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository-url>
cd als
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run the server
./als
```

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - This project is currently in the design and early implementation phase. See the [Roadmap](./Roadmap.md) for detailed progress tracking.

## Integration with Spectrum IDE

The ALS will replace the current language analysis components in Spectrum IDE:
- **Current**: `AlifLexer.cpp`, `AlifComplete.cpp` (in-process)
- **Future**: ALS server (out-of-process, LSP-based)

This transition will provide:
- Better performance and responsiveness
- More sophisticated language features
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Support for other editors
