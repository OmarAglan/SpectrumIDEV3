## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Request Processing Flow
1. **Message Reception**: JsonRpcProtocol reads from stdin with Content-Length parsing
2. **Request Parsing**: Extract method, params, and request ID with validation
3. **Dispatch**: RequestDispatcher routes to appropriate handler with middleware
4. **Task Creation**: Handler creates work task for ThreadPool with prioritization
5. **Background Processing**: Worker thread executes analysis with cancellation support
6. **Result Compilation**: Worker prepares response data with error handling
7. **Response Delivery**: Main thread sends JSON-RPC response with proper formatting

### Thread Safety Design
- **Lock-free Operations**: Atomic operations for performance-critical paths
- **Mutex Protection**: Strategic locking for shared resources
- **RAII Patterns**: Automatic resource management
- **Cancellation Tokens**: Safe task cancellation without race conditions

## ‚è≥ Remaining Work (Phase 1)

### Production Logging Integration
- **Task**: Replace std::cout with structured spdlog logging
- **Scope**: 
  - Configurable log levels (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
  - File and console logging support
  - Structured logging with context information
  - Integration with middleware for request tracing
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Priority**: Low (current logging is functional for development)

## üöÄ Phase 2 Readiness

The completed Phase 1 infrastructure provides a solid foundation for Phase 2 development:

### Ready for Language Analysis
- **Async Processing**: ThreadPool ready for parsing and analysis tasks
- **Request Routing**: RequestDispatcher ready for LSP feature handlers
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery for language analysis failures
- **Cancellation**: Support for cancelling long-running analysis operations

### Integration Points
- **Lexer Integration**: Ready to integrate existing AlifLexer components
